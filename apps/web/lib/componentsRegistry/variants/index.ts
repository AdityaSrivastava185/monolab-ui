/**
 * Component Variants Index
 *
 * This file exports all component variants from their individual files.
 * Each component has its own variants file for better maintainability.
 *
 * To add variants for a new component:
 * 1. Create a new file: /variants/[name].tsx
 * 2. Export the variants array from that file
 * 3. Add the export here
